# Some XOD nodes

XOD is a flow-based-programming tool for programming arduino. See https://xod.io && https://github.com/xodio/xod .

This (https://github.com/awgrover/xod_lib) is a library of nodes for it. Some may be useful. Some may be ill conceived.

# Installation

The XOD project is working on an easier way to install libraries, until then you have to put the 'awg' directory into the xod workspace lib manually.

1. From this github repository https://github.com/awgrover/xod_lib
1. Click "clone or download", click "Download zip"
1. Open the downloaded zip, or let your OS just open it as it downloads.
1. Navigate into the zip, inside 'lib'. So you can see the 'awg' directory.
1. Find your xod workspace: run xod, choose File:Select Workspace. Note the "Current workspace directory". You can probabably select and copy it.
1. Open your file-explorer, and navigate to the xod workspace.
1. Drag 'awg' from the zip to 'lib' in the workspace.
1. It's installed.
1. Do a "reload" in XOD.
1. My libs should be visible and usable.
